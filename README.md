## Use of git repo
During the development of this project, git and GitHub were used to create backups after every new function was added to ensure a stable version was available. Branching was used when working with new installs which could affect the overall project, such as with the modals being added. Both the frontend (angular application) and backend (node server) were stored under the same directory, so only one git repo was required for the entire project.

## Data Structure
The two main data structures were users and groups, all required information was stored in these two. The storage of these arrays were done via seperate JavaScript files in the server, and saved to JSON files as a temporary storage solution. The layout of these data structures are shown below:

### Users:
```
username: string,
email: string,
password: string,
roles: string[],
groups: [
  {
    name: string,
    id: number,
    admin: boolean
  }
]
```

### Groups:
```
name: string,
id: number,
channels: string[],
joinRequests: string[]
```

## Routing
All routing goes through Server.js, but is split between two sub routes ```/account/???``` and ```/group/???```
